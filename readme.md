To-Do List

##HTML Stuff
- ~~Add an icon for cloning the sticky~~
- ~~Add text input area for sticky~~
- Add ability to change sticky color

##JS Stuff
- ~~Populate brainstorm-board w/ divs based on the # of lessons in the splash div~~
- listen to the id of the form and submit on that id 
- After submit,
1. ~~Smooth scroll~~
2. ~~get the value~~
3. ~~populate the divs (use append)~~
4. ~~Adjust the CSS for the divs to fit the brainstorm board based on how many lessons. possibly grab the value in a global variable ~~
5. Add media queries

- When a sticky is cloned it is appended to the "sticky-generator"
- ~~The sticky becomes draggable and can be moved onto the "brainstorm-board"~~
- When a sticky is moved to the "brainstorm-board" it is actually a clone that is dragged so the original stays in the sticky generator 

##CS Stuff
- ~~Create div style for stickies~~
