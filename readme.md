To-Do List

##HTML Stuff
- ~~Add an icon for cloning the sticky~~
- ~~Add text input area for sticky~~
- Add ability to change sticky color

##JS Stuff
1. ~~Populate brainstorm-board w/ divs based on the # of lessons in the splash div~~
2. ~~listen to the id of the form and submit on that id~~ 
3. ~~Smooth scroll~~
4. ~~get the value of the lesson #~~
5. ~~populate the divs (use append)~~
6. ~~Adjust the CSS for the divs to fit the brainstorm board based on how many lessons~~
7. Add media queries

- When a sticky is cloned it is appended to the "sticky-generator"
- ~~The sticky becomes draggable and can be moved onto the "brainstorm-board"~~
- When a sticky is moved to the "brainstorm-board" it is actually a clone that is dragged so the original stays in the sticky generator 

##CS Stuff
- ~~Create div style for stickies~~
